# SoundCenSe

Based on ZweiStein's SoundSense, this is a c# port to get rid of installing java on windows systems.

Using the NAudio libraries of Mark Heath there is now full volume control over all audio channels.

*System requirements:*

Windows + .NET 4.5.1 (might get lower in the future, need to finish the code first)

Memory footprint is spiking up to 500MB (caching the sounds, there will be a future option for low memory systems, but that increases cpu load), normally around 70-80MB
